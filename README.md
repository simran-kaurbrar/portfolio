# portfolio

This portfolio project is like a digital resume where I share my professional story. Here's what you'll find:

About Section on Home Page:  I introduce myself briefly—what I do, and what I'm all about.

Resume Page: It is a detailed look into my work history. I lay out all my experiences, skills, and qualifications in one place so you can see what I bring to the table.

Education Page: This part talks about my schooling and what I've learned along the way. It's like a peek into my academic journey—where I've been and what I've studied.

Contact Page:It has my contact information! If you want to chat, collaborate, or just say hi, you can reach me here.

Overall, this portfolio is my way of putting my best foot forward professionally and making it easy for you to get to know me better.
